# OIBSIP-Sales-Prediction-Using-Python

This repository contains a project for predicting sales using Python as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP). The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of machine learning models to forecast sales.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales based on historical data. The project includes steps such as data collection, cleaning, analysis, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand trends, patterns, and correlations.
Model Training: Implementing and training various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
